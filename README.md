### What I learned

There was alot of things to review in css. I learned more about positioning with absolute. In all of my projects i mainly use bootstrap for styling. I think its easier to manage but for this profile card i had to use absolute positioning in order to create a circular area to fit the picture. The css positioning is still something i am still trying to master.

### Continued development

I am still trying to understand z-index and the grid system. I was going to use them in this project but i realized that the profile card can be done without the 2. As part of the frontEnd mentor challange, I still need to work with the background image. There is a certain way that it needs to be displayed
